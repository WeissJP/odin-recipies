        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This mac and cheese was a staple throughout my childhood&mdash;and my dad's childhood as well&mdash;so this is a very "vintage" recipe channelling mid-century Americana. I added the bacon because why would you not add bacon? Our family is sharply divided on the question of ketchup on mac and cheese. Some consider it essential, others consider it a travesty. Put the ketchup bottle on the table or not depending on where you come down on this delicate question.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb. dry large elbow macaroni noodles</li>
            <li>1 stick butter (½ cup)</li>
            <li>2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>¾ tsp. ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ tsp. dry mustard powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup flour</li>
            <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 lb. Velveeta cheese, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>½ lb. bacon, cut into 1” pieces</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F.</li>
            <li>Fill a stock pot with salted water and bring to a boil. Add the noodles and cook according to package directions (usually 10 minutes or so). Drain and set aside—but don&apos;t leave it long enough for it to solidify into a big wad.</li>
            <li>In a heavy Dutch oven, melt the butter. Add the salt, pepper, mustard, Worcestershire, and flour. Stir it all together and cook for a minute or so, which will help to get rid of the flour taste. Slowly add the milk while whisking. Whisk until the flour mixture is incorporated and continue to stir until it boils and thickens. Reduce heat to low. Begin adding the chunks of Velveeta and stir until they are fully melted and incorporated.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked noodles and stir until they are completely coated with the cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Transfer the whole pot of mac and cheese to the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes or until the brownness of the top meets your personal specifications.</li>
            <li>While the mac and cheese is baking, fry the bacon in a heavy pan until it is crispy but not black. Remove from pan and drain on a plate lined with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Once the mac and cheese comes out of the oven, sprinkle the bacon evenly over the top and serve.</li>
        </ol>
