        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This mac and cheese was a staple throughout my childhood&mdash;and my dad's childhood as well&mdash;so this is a very "vintage" recipe channelling mid-century Americana. I added the bacon because why would you not add bacon? Our family is sharply divided on the question of ketchup on mac and cheese. Some consider it essential, others consider it a travesty. Put the ketchup bottle on the table or not depending on where you come down on this delicate question.</p>
