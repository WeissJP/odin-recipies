This project is part of the HTML section in The Odin Project Introductory course. I will have used skills from both previous courses and projects, and The Odin Project, to create this website.

NOTE: Two of the recipes are from www.allrecipes.com (Blackened Chicken & Peach Bars); the third is from a family cookbook.
